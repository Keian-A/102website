                German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline,
                presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy
                trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds.

                There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say
                their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for
                many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds
                will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there’s a “certain
                aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.”

                The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue—and sometimes
                one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed,
                Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than
                60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. In
                fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger,
                brawnier dog than what is the standard for the breed.

                As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; their innate
                friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. This breed is also energetic and can’t resist chasing
                small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Siberians are
                naturally clean, with little doggy odor.

                Bearing a passing resemblance to their smaller cousin, the Lhasa Apso, Tibetan Terriers reside at the
                lower end of medium-sized breeds, standing about 15 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 20 and
                24 pounds. A breed hallmark is the beautiful and profuse double coat—wooly underneath, with a long, fine
                topcoat. TTs are unique among dogs for their large, flat “snowshoe” feet, adapted over centuries to help
                them negotiate the snowy, mountainous terrain of their homeland.
